## About

<table>
<tr>
<td>

This project is highly inspired by [ztncui](https://github.com/key-networks/ztncui) and was developed to address the current limitations of applying the self-hosted [network controllers](https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/tree/master/controller). Some [ztncui](https://github.com/key-networks/ztncui) problems cannot be fixed because of the core architecture of the project. ZeroUI tries to solve them and implements the following features:

- Full React-powered lightweight [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) that brings a better user experience, and ZeroUI is mobile-friendly.
- ZeroUI has ZeroTier Central compatible API. That means you could use CLI tools and custom applications made only for ZeroTier Central to manage your networks.
- ZeroUI implements controller-specific workarounds that address some existing [issues](https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/issues/859). ZTNCUI [does not](https://github.com/key-networks/ztncui/issues/63).
- ZeroUI is more feature complete. ZeroUI has almost all network-controller-supported features, for example, rule editor. The development process hasn't stopped, so you will enjoy new features and bug fixes shortly.
- ZeroUI deployment is simple. Please refer to [installation](#installation) for more info.

### Built With

Frontend:

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com)

Backend:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
- [Lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb)

Ready to use deployment solution:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The recommended method to install ZeroUI is by using Docker and Docker Compose.
To install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) on your system, please follow the installation guide from the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker).

For HTTPS setup you will need a domain name. You can get it for free at https://www.duckdns.org.

### Installation

The most simple one-minute installation. Great for the fresh VPS setup.

1. Create a project directory

```sh
mkdir -p /srv/zero-ui/
cd /srv/zero-ui/
```

2. Download the `docker-compose.yml` file

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dec0dOS/zero-ui/main/docker-compose.yml
```

or

```sh
curl -L -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dec0dOS/zero-ui/main/docker-compose.yml
```

3. Replace `YOURDOMAIN.com` with your domain name and set admin credentials (`ZU_DEFAULT_PASSWORD`) in `docker-compose.yml`
4. Pull the image

```sh
docker pull dec0dos/zero-ui
```

5. Run the containers

```sh
docker-compose up -d --no-build
```

6. Check if everything is okay (`CTRL-C` to stop log preview)

```sh
docker-compose logs -f
```

7. Disable your firewall for the following ports: `80/tcp`, `443/tcp` and `9993/udp`

- on Ubuntu/Debian with ufw installed:

```sh
 ufw allow 80/tcp
 ufw allow 443/tcp
 ufw allow 9993/udp
```

- or you may use the old good iptables:

```sh
 iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
 iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
 iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 9993 -j ACCEPT
```

8. Navigate to `https://YOURDOMAIN.com/app/`.
   Now you could use your ZeroUI instance with HTTPS support and automated certificate renewal.

> To disable Caddy proxy and HTTPS, remove the `https-proxy` from `docker-compose.yml`, set `ZU_SECURE_HEADERS` to `false` and change zero-ui port `expose` to `ports`.

Advanced manual setups are also supported. Check the following environment variables as a reference:
| Name | Default value | Description |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NODE_ENV | unset | You could learn more [here](https://nodejs.dev/learn/nodejs-the-difference-between-development-and-production) |
| LISTEN_ADDRESS | `0.0.0.0` | Express server listen address |
| ZU_SERVE_FRONTEND | `true` | You could disable frontend serving and use ZeroUI instance as REST API for your ZeroTier controller |
| ZU_SECURE_HEADERS | `true` | Enables [helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io) |
| ZU_CONTROLLER_ENDPOINT | `http://localhost:9993/` | ZeroTier controller API endpoint |
| ZU_CONTROLLER_TOKEN | from `/var/lib/zerotier-one/authtoken.secret` | ZeroTier controller API token |
| ZU_DEFAULT_USERNAME | unset (`docker-compose.yml`: admin) | Default username that will be set on the first run |
| ZU_DEFAULT_PASSWORD | unset (`docker-compose.yml`: zero-ui) | Default password that will be set on the first run |
| ZU_DATAPATH | `data/db.json` | ZeroUI data storage path |
| ZU_DISABLE_AUTH | unset | If set to true, automatically log in all users. This is useful if ZeroUI is protected by an authentication proxy. Note that when this value is changed, the localStorage of instances of logged-in panels should be cleared |
| ZU_LAST_SEEN_FETCH | `true`| Enables [Last Seen feature](https://github.com/dec0dOS/zero-ui/issues/40) |
| ZU_LAST_SEEN_SCHEDULE | `*/5 * * * *` | Last Seen cron-like schedule |

ZeroUI could be deployed as a regular nodejs web application, but it requires a ZeroTier controller that is installed with the `zerotier-one` package. For more info about the network controller, you could read [here](https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/tree/master/controller/#readme).

For Ansible Role, please refer to [zero-ui-ansible repo](https://github.com/dec0dOS/zero-ui-ansible).

<details>
<summary>Controller setup tips (outside the Docker)</summary>
<br>

If you are using the existing controller on the host, it may be necessary to allow connection from the Docker container.
You could do it in two ways:

1. Allowing controller management from any IP address:

```sh
echo "{\"settings\": {\"portMappingEnabled\": true,\"softwareUpdate\": \"disable\",\"allowManagementFrom\": [\"0.0.0.0/0\"]}}" > /var/lib/zerotier-one/local.conf
```

> Warning: don't forget to block connections to 9993/TCP from WAN. Direct controller API does not mean to be exposed to WAN, it should be proxified via the ZeroUI backend.

2. Adding `network_mode: "host"` to zero-ui in docker-compose.yml.

More info is provided in the following [discussion](https://github.com/dec0dOS/zero-ui/discussions/8).

</details>

## Usage

After installation, log in with your credentials that are declared with ZU_DEFAULT_USERNAME and ZU_DEFAULT_PASSWORD.

Currently, almost all main ZeroTier Central features are available. Refer to the [roadmap](#roadmap) for more information.

_For the screenshots, please refer to the [screenshots](docs/SCREENSHOTS.md)._

### Update

To get the latest version just run

```sh
docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d --no-build
```

in the folder where `docker-compose.yml` is located. Backup is not required as your data is saved in Docker volumes but recommended.
You could also set up [watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower) for automatic updates.

```sh
docker run -d \
 --name watchtower \
 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
 --restart always \
 containrrr/watchtower \
 --cleanup --include-restarting \
 zu-main zu-controller
```

### Backup

You should regularly back up the `zerotier-one` and `data` folders in your ZeroUI installation directory.
You should do it manually before the upgrade via the following commands:

```sh
tar cvf backup-ui.tar data/
tar cvf backup-zt.tar zerotier-one/
```

### Development environment

To set up a development environment, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dec0dOS/zero-ui.git
cd zero-ui
```

2. Install packages

```sh
yarn install
```

3. Start the development server

```sh
yarn dev
```

4. Navigate to http://localhost:3000

It is also required to install the ZeroTier controller. On Linux installing the `zerotier-one` package is enough, other platforms require some tweaking. Firstly you should get the controller token. On macOS, you could find it with the following command:

```sh
sudo cat "/Library/Application Support/ZeroTier/One/authtoken.secret"
```

After you could start the ZeroUI development environment:

```sh
ZU_CONTROLLER_TOKEN=TOKEN_FROM_authtoken.secret yarn dev
```

_For other platforms, please refer to [ZeroTier manual](https://www.zerotier.com/manual/#4)._
